## Project Introduction and Objective

Seasonal influenza remains a persistent public health challenge in the United States, affecting 20 to 40 million individuals annually. The goal of this project is to develop reliable weekly forecasts of influenza-like-illness (ILI) using historical data from the CDC ILINet surveillance system. Accurate forecasting enables hospitals and public health agencies to prepare for surge of ILI, allocate staff and resources, and engage in a timely manner.

This project evaluates several classical time series forecasting methods, compares their performance, and identifies a modeling strategy capable of capturing both stable seasonal dynamics and irregular disruptions such as the 2009 H1N1 outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19.
